# dnb-lunch-balance
Some simple python scripts to get current balance in the DNB cantina at Bj√∏rvika Oslo

The script will use the microsmycentral portal to fetch the current balance of the user, and push it as a osx notification.

Username/email is stored in username.txt file, password stored in OSX keychain.


## Prerequisites
Currently python 2.7, let's make this 3.7 asap. Otherwise, requests.txt and terminal-notifier as indicated by `installer.sh`

    python main.py
    Add dnb email: john.doe@dnb.no
    Add password:

A notification will show up:
